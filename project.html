            <h2>Metaverse</h2>
            <p>The Metaverse isn't just a VR world open to communication. 
                <br>But it's also an experience that connects people between the real world and the digital world. 
                <br>By using various types of technology. 
                <br>In the future, I would like to participate in the creation of Multiverse as a game.</p>

            <h2>Animation 3D</h2>
            <p>“Animation 3D” in the minds of most people.
                <br>This is an animated film cute face Or strange shapes, 
                <br>bright colors that are suitable for children, 
                <br>but in fact the term “Animation 3D” is not used to create a cartoon movie for children only. 
                <br>But also related to the multimedia type of work that is specific to those 
                <br>who have direct knowledge in this field You can see that there are many companies that do 3D animation services. 
                <br>So I would like to develop my Animation 3D creation and do this project in the future.</p>
